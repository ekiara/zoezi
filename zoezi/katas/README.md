2. Register, Verify, Drip

    - Once they register they'll get a drip email campaign over two weeks

3. 'Library' or 'Record-Keeping' something, Plus using Django with Redis
    - Learn some redis (thus some devops)
    - Library/Records need to be at least 'six-figures' i.e. 100,000+

4. Flask app that talks to sqlite
    - Basic flask app
    - Read and write to sqlite3
    - Do all of C-R-U-D

5. Generate a crap-ton of data
    - The biggest problem I have with new projects is getting realistic data so
      ho can I generate large amounts of data that looks "almost right"?

6. 'micro-reddit' in Flask and Sinatra (yes, do this using both frameworks, so at least twice)
    - User posts a message (title, text-in-markdown)
    - Response to the title are shown heirachically (i.e. nested threads)
    - Full text search

7. web-mail interface
    - Django web-mail interface that reads/writes Maildir or mbox
    - Search?
    - Gmail-esque features
